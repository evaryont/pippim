A ruby clone of the UNIX command cal.

This program is split into 2: A client and server.

The server looks for all files with .ics as extensions in the folder calendars/ in the same directory as it is.
The client connects to this server via DRb and generates the calendar itself in stdout. NOTE: require 'rubygems' is commented out in vpim_cal.rb due to the dramatic speed drop it introduces, to get the best performance out of PipPIM, run ruby with the -I parameter, e.g. "ruby -I/usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/vpim-0.658/lib/ -I/usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/facets-2.5.0/lib/more/"

Dependencies:
	VPIM [http://vpim.rubyforge.org]
	Facets (for ANSI color output) [http://facets.rubyforge.org]
