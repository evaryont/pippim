PipPIM

To often have I seen great applications not use standard file formats. A primary example is remind, which is used by many. It has it's own file format instead of using the iCal specification. PipPIM is a ruby based PIM designed to fill in perceived gaps in the Linux PIM 'industry'.

Planned Features:
Online Synchronization
NCurses interface(s)
A contact manager (using the vcard format)
A todo list (using the iCal format as well)

So far, this PIM suite only has a calendar.

INFORMATION ABOUT THE CALENDAR:

A ruby clone of the UNIX command cal.
------

This program is split into 2: A client and server.

The server looks for all files with .ics as extensions in the folder calendars/ in the same directory as it is.
The client connects to this server via DRb and generates the calendar itself in stdout. NOTE: require 'rubygems' is commented out in vpim_cal.rb due to the dramatic speed drop it introduces, to get the best performance out of PipPIM, run ruby with the -I parameter, e.g. "ruby -I/usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/vpim-0.658/lib/ -I/usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/facets-2.5.0/lib/more/"

== Dependencies:
VPIM [http://vpim.rubyforge.org]

== How to run vpim_cal:
Start the server:
  ruby pippim_server.rb
And it will sit there, don't worry, it's running.

Run the client:
  ruby cal.rb
And out should pop a calendar
