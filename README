PipPIM

To often have I seen great applications not use standard file formats. A primary example is remind, which is used by many. It has it's own file format instead of using the iCal specification. PipPIM is a ruby based PIM designed to fill in perceived gaps in the Linux PIM 'industry'.

Planned Features:
Online Synchronization
NCurses interface(s)


Structure:
cal/ - This contains a ruby clone of UNIX cal. It comes in two parts - a client and server. See the README inside for more info.
